# Accenture-Project-Management-Virtual-Experience-Program

• Completed a job simulation where I acted as a project manager for a hypothetical client who was launching a new brand.

• Mapped suitable project management approaches including Plan Driven, Agile, Second Agile, and Hybrid to a portfolio of projects.

• Presented a project status update to senior leadership and project team members.

I recently participated in Accenture’s Project Management job simulation on Forage, and it 
was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate in a consulting team 
at Accenture. I thoroughly enjoyed developing an in-depth understanding of various project management 
approaches like Agile and Hybrid, and then applying those approaches to a portfolio of 
different projects. When I presented my project status update to senior leaders and the project 
team members, it helped me to realize that I really enjoy managing a team to solve 
engaging and complex problems that involve multiple stakeholders.
I would love to apply what I’ve learned in a consulting team at Accenture
